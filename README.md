# CompeteCoding

The repository stores my code for some algorithm contests.

And my basic template lies on [templat/template.cpp](./competeCoding/templat/template.cpp).

If you have any question, please concat me via gmail.


## Goal

My initial goal is to finish some problems on codeforce or atcoder.
